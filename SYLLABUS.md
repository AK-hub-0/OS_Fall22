# CS311 Operating Systems Course Syllabus

## Course Introduction.
An Operating System manages all of the computer's resources and presents users with a virtual view of machines that are easier to manage and program, than underlying hardware. This course provides an overview of fundamental operating system principles, complemented with discussions of services provided by modern systems. The course shall provide a good grasp of basic abstractions employed in system-level software (e.g., processes, threads, virtual memory, caching, etc.) to uncover the "magic" that happens inside the box (computer).
