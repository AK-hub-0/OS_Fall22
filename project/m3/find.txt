Implement the find command on this link:
[find](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/labs/util.html)

Implement the find command.

Syntax: find [PATH] NAME

Arguments:
    PATH: path to the directory under which search will be performed.
    When present, PATH will always preceed NAME. In case PATH is not present,
    assume the current directory to be the PATH.

    NAME: name of the file to be searched.

Working: searches recursively for the file titled NAME at the given PATH.
    In case any occurences of file titled NAME is found, it prints each
    occurence on a separate line with a full path. If no occurence is found
    it should print "File NAME not found at location PATH".

Hints:
   - Look at user/ls.c to see how to read directories.
   - Use recursion to allow find to descend into sub-directories.
   - Don't recurse into "." and "..".  
   - xv6 does not provide string functions, you might have to make your own.
   - put your solution in file called: user/find.c
