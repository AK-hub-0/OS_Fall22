Implement the uniq command.

Syntax: uniq FILEPATH

Working: it prints all the unique lines of the file, i.e., if any line
    is repeated, it will be printed only once, at its first occurrence.
    For simplicity, you can assume that the file will not contain more
    than 100 lines and each line will have no more than 20 characters.
    Check for the existance of the file and if missing output an error
    message.

ARGUMENTS:
    FILEPATH: either a filepath or a name of a file in current directory.
