Implemnet the tree command (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(command))

Syntax: tree DIRPATH

Working: it lists all the files and directories in the DIRPATH,
    recursively, looking like a tree, i.e., the files further
    down in the hierarchy are listed further to the right. Better
    install the tree command on your linux system and see its
    working.

Arguments:
    DIRPATH: the path to directory whose content is to be displayed.
    If this argument is not provided, it should display the content
    of the current directory.
