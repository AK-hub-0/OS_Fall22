Implement the sort command.

Syntax: sort FILEPATH

Working: it sorts and prints all the lines of the file in sorted order.
    For simplicity, you can assume that the file will not contain more
    than 100 lines and each line will have no more than 20 characters.
    Check for the existance of the file and if missing output an error
    message.

ARGUMENTS:
    FILEPATH: either a filepath or a name of a file in current directory.
