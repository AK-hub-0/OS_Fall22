Implement the head command.

Syntax: head -N FILEPATH

Working: should display the first N lines of the file at FILEPATH.
    If there are less than N lines in the file, then only display those.
    If the option -N is not present, it should display the first 3 lines
    by default.

Arguents:
    -N: N is an integer indicating number of lines to be displayed.
    FILEPATH: can either a filepath or a filename. you should check for
    its existance and output an error in case the file does not exist.
