Implement the touch command:

Working: touch FILEPATH ...

Working: Given one or more filenames/filepaths it creats them as empty
    files. If any of the files already exists, it leaves it alone. If
    it fails in creating any file, it outputs a message informing the
    user about which file it failed to create.

Arguments:
    FILEPATH ... : one or more filenames or filepaths to be created.
