Implement the diff command.

Syntax: diff FILEPATH1 FILEPATH2

Working: it should compare the two files line by line and output
    the lines which are not the same in the two files. The outputted
    lines should be preceeded by their line numbers and chevrons (>>>
    for FILEPATH1 adn <<< for FILEPATH2). It before comparing it should
    check whether FILEPATH1 or FILEPATH2 exist and output an error
    if any of of the two does not.

ARGUMENTS:
    FILEPATH1: path of the first file to compare. could be full path
    or a name in current directory.
    FILEPATH2: path of the second file to compare. could be full path
    or a name in current directory.
